## Hi! 🏔️

I'm Francesco, a geotechnical engineer from Lima, Peru, working in the mining industry. I specialize in numerical modeling, spatial variability, and soil behavior — especially in complex systems like tailings dams and heap leach pads.

Right now, I'm preparing for a PhD in Geotechnical Engineering, and continuing to explore new ways to blend research, programming, and field practice.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- 📊 Modeling spatial variability in leached ore using **SCPTu** data and geostatistics.
- 🦀 Building [`cone`](https://github.com/ffrancoa/cone), a command-line tool in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) to explore CSV/XLSX files using [`polars`](https://pola.rs/).
- 📈 Generating anisotropic random fields with [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/).
- 🧵 Learning [**Haskell**](https://www.haskell.org/) to sharpen my understanding of functional programming and abstraction.

### 🧰 Tools & Languages I Use Often

- **Programming:** Rust, Julia and Haskell (also Python when it is needed)
- **Geotechical software:** Slide2, RS2 and FLAC 8.1
