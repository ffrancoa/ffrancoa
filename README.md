## Hi! 🏔️

I'm Francesco, a geotechnical engineer from Lima, Peru, specializing in numerical modeling, spatial variability, and soil behavior — particularly in mining geotechnics and complex systems like tailings dams and heap leach pads.

My core interest is advancing geotechnical research and engineering practice through computational methods. While geotechnics is my profession and passion, I also deeply enjoy programming as a creative and technical hobby. I see code as a powerful companion in my work — not as a career path on its own.

Right now, I'm preparing for a PhD in Geotechnical Engineering and focusing on integrating modern programming tools into my research workflows.

### 🛠️ Current Projects

- 📊 Modeling spatial variability in leached ore using **SCPTu** data and geostatistics.
- 🦀 Developing [`cone`](https://github.com/ffrancoa/cone), a command-line tool in [**Rust**](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for exploring SCPTu profiles from CSV/XLSX files.
- 📈 Generating anisotropic random fields for spatial modeling with [**Julia**](https://julialang.org/).
- 🧩 Writing constitutive models for FLAC using **C++**, with experiments in **Rust FFI**.
